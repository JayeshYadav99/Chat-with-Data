## üîê Setting Up Clerk with Supabase Storage Access

To secure file access and manage storage per user, you‚Äôll use **Clerk JWT Templates** with Supabase policies:

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. **Create a Supabase JWT template in Clerk**
   - Go to Clerk dashboard ‚Üí JWT Templates ‚Üí Create Template
   - Use Supabase‚Äôs recommended settings and ensure the `sub` claim maps to the user's ID.

2. **Attach the token to Supabase client requests**
   - In your Supabase client:
     ```ts
     const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, {
       global: {
         headers: {
           Authorization: `Bearer ${await getToken({ template: 'supabase' })}`,
         },
       },
     });
     ```

3. **Write RLS policies on `storage.objects`**
   In Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Allow users to insert/select their own files
   create policy "Users can insert their own files"
   on storage.objects
   for insert
   to  authenticated
   with check (auth.role() = 'authenticated'::text);


   create policy "Users can read their own files"
   on storage.objects
   for select
   to  authenticated
   with check (auth.role() = 'authenticated'::text);
   ```

   Ensure the bucket is private.
